     <p>It is said that Books are our best friends and yeah it is true. They are my best friends too I don't like any book in specific I like all that I read. I have read many books and there are many yet to read in my home and in the world. Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. Books can hold and keep all kinds of information, stories, thoughts and feelings unlike anything else in this world.</p>

       <h4>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</h4>
